# leapfrog-triejoin
High-performance (C++) implementation of the leapfrog-triejoin algorithm by Todd Veldhuizen (http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0481)

The leapfrog-triejoin algorihm is a worst-case optimal conjunctive join algorithm, that has since then found widespread usage in industry.

This code was written as central part of the "Database Systems and Implementation" final course exam part of the MSc Computer Science degree at the University of Oxford, UK. It received a First.
